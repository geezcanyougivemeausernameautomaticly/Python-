MacOS has introduced .zshrc as the new default interactive shell
However, here is the instructions from pycharm

1.Run the following command to find the user base's binary directory:
  $ python -m site --user-base
  An example of output can be
  /Users/jetbrains/.local (masOS) or /home/jetbrains/.local (Linux)
  
2.Add bin to this path to receive a string for adding to the ~/.bashrc file, for example:
  $ export PATH="$PATH:/Users/jetbrains/.local/bin"
  
3.Run the following command to make the changes effective:
  $ source ~/.bashrc
  
4.Ensure you have enabled bashrc in your bash_profile.

I followed the instructions but only got one error return
"zsh: no such user or named directory: .bashrc"
So, building a new .bash_profile and .bashrc
did the instructions again
Typed in "pipenv" in terminal 
Yes, it was done!
Back to pycharm, it still count not auto detect the pipenv
After restarting the terminal, tried "pipenv", everything back to the beginning, not happened except error

I googled a lot, seems that all solutions referred to add PATH to .bashrc or .bash_profile
.........
Until I checked terminal again, I finally realized that .... well, I am using zsh....

So, the final solution is quite easy

1.Typing "cd ~/(yourusername)"
2.Enter "touch .bash_profile"
3.      "open .bash_profile"
4.A new window will pop-up, filename is .bash_profile
  Write "PATH="$PATH:/Users/(yourusername)/.local/bin"  #Which is the default root pipenv will be installed using "pip install pipenv"
  Command + S  -> to save .bash_profile
5.Enter "open .zshrc"
  Write "source ~/.bash_profile"
  Command + S -> save .zshrc
6.Enter "source ~/.zshrc"
  Terminate the terminal
7.Restart pycharm and now pipenv can be auto-detected


Further info about how to set the system default python version as the vitrual development evrionment
The default root for pyenv installed python is 
"/Users/(yourusername)/.pyenv/versions/3.10.5/bin/python"

Now all set, I can start 大蟒蛇咯
